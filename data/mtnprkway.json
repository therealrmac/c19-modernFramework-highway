		"name": "Bert T Combs Mountain Parkway",
		"info": "The Mountain Parkway, known as the Eastern Kentucky Turnpike during planning, opened as a toll road in 1963 and was widely heralded as opening up eastern Kentucky to the rest of the state. In 1976, the road was renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in honor of the former governor who is widely credited with getting the road built. Tolls were lifted west of Campton in 1985 and to the east the following year. The parkway is 75.627 miles long. The four lane portion is 43.104 miles long; the two-lane portion (known as the Mountain Parkway Extension) is 32.523 miles long."
